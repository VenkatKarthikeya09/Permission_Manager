# Permission_Manager
The Permission Manager is a web-based application designed to enhance digital privacy and security by enabling users to monitor, analyze, and manage the permissions granted to installed applications. With the growing number of apps requesting extensive permissions, often beyond their functional requirements, there is a significant risk of privacy invasion and data leakage. This project aims to empower users with complete control over app permissions, providing real-time insights and actionable solutions.

The system is developed using Java Servlets, deployed on an Apache Tomcat server, and uses MySQL for data storage. The front-end interface is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, ensuring a responsive and user-friendly experience.
Upon logging in, users can scan their devices or applications for installed apps and view detailed permission information. The platform provides features such as:
•	App scanning and permission monitoring
•	Data leakage detection
•	Permission comparison with safe benchmarks
•	Background service monitoring
•	Uninstall recommendations for suspicious applications
•	App safety scoring based on permission usage and behavior
•	Permission revocation tools

The application presents its findings through clean dashboards and detailed reports, enabling users to make informed decisions regarding their installed applications. The system also focuses on educating users about potential risks by clearly highlighting unsafe permissions and providing recommendations for better security practices.
By combining efficient backend processing, database-driven analysis, and interactive front-end design, the Permission Manager ensures privacy control, transparency, and digital safety in an increasingly app-dependent world.
